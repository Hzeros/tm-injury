# Ambient temperature related injury mortality

This project introduces the data availability of the article "Temperature-related mortality in China from specific injury"，including:

(1) Injury mortality data: Due to governance constraints and the identifiable nature of the data, these data are not publicly available.The raw data should be requested through collaboration with the corresponding author's team, subject to the approval of the data management and all authors, which is determined within 12 weeks.

(2)Meteorological data: Due to protocols, we cannot share meteorological data from monitoring stations directly, but data can be requested from the China Meteorological Data Sharing Service system(CMDSSS, http://data.cma.cn/data/detail/dataCode/A.0013.0001.html). This requires registering an account and being authenticated to have limited download access. Alternatively, a purchase agreement can be signed directly with CMDSSS.

(3)Projected temperature of CMIP5 GCM data: We have previously downloaded the projected temperatures of CMIP5 GCM data from the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project. However, this data is no longer available for public download, but can still be obtained by sending a request via email (isimip-data@pik-potsdam.de). Detailed information can be found at https://www.isimip.org/protocol/fast-track-simulation-protocol. Although no longer publicly downloadable, the data are still widely used in the field of environmental health risk assessment，such as:

(4)GIS covariates: The GIS covariates are available from the Data Center for Resources and Environmental Sciences(https://www.resdc.cn), inclding GDP spatial distribution grid data(https://www.resdc.cn/DOI/DOI.aspx?DOIID=33), land use land cover remote sensing monitoring data(https://www.resdc.cn/DOI/DOI.aspx?DOIID=54), road data(https://www.resdc.cn/data.aspx?DATAID=237).This data is subject to agreement requirements and we are unable to disclose it. To request data you need to register an account on the platform and be authenticated before you can submit a data request.

(5)Air pollution data: Air pollution data for each hour can be captured from the National Real Time Urban Air Quality Release Platform (https://air.cnemc.cn:18007/). It can be downloaded directly from this project.

(6)Population density data: The population density data are available from GeoData Institute in University of Southampton (https://hub.worldpop.org/geodata/listing?id=91). It also can be downloaded directly from this project.

(7)Future populations: The future populations under five SSPs are available from International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (https://tntcat.iiasa.ac.at/SspDb/dsd?Action=htmlpage&page=30). It also can be downloaded directly from this project.

(8)Characteristics of each province: Data on province characteristics are available on the government's statistic yearbooks(http://www.stats.gov.cn/tjsj/ndsj/2018/indexch.htm).It also can be downloaded directly from this project.
